Welcome to the new home of the _Geax Code_ blog... my channel for sharing musings &amp; ideas on code, business, technology, photography, the list goes on and on.... but mostly about Code!

Based on the **Beautiful Jekyll** theme, running on Github Pages, using CloudFlare DNS... it's amazing what we can accomplish these days with the combined power of open-source projects (thanks to all), and great services by great companies like CloudFlare & Microsoft (Github)!

GitHub hosts websites and pages! For many this isn't new news, as GitHub Pages has been around since 2008 (_umm, researching...oh wow, yep I'm humbled at my ignorance_). So what's new with this blog?  Well, nothing actually, even at the original launch it was powered by [Jekyll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_(software)).

For me it was a pleasant surprise though to find that this is a fully free service. I figured this out quickly after researching a thought that I had about using a Repo Wiki as a great place to start blogging and saving articles/write-up/docs about my random meddlings in technology.

Now, I assume it has evolved since the 2008 release in many ways, and is now hosted under a different domain (github.io). And supports some nifty features that bring many many other sites like this one to life in a much more friendly way than a Repo Wiki (my initial idea) would have allowed.

Serving the pages directly via it's own Url, you can get a site fully up and running quickly using only GitHub pages if you're happy with the url format they provide: `http:/your-github-username.github.io`

But, with the free services offerred by CloudFlare, you can use your own personal domain. I set my CloudFlare domain up initially because of the need for a variety of subdomains for my personal use with home automation, personal servers running as Dockers (via Unraid), etc.

So immediately I realized this should be easy, and sure enough it was even easier than I originally thought thanks to CloudFlare now supporting what they call [CName Flattening](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cname-flattening-rfc-compliant-cnames-at-a-domains-root/).


//TODO:  Update with additional technical details helpful about how I set this up with GitPages & Cloudflare!
