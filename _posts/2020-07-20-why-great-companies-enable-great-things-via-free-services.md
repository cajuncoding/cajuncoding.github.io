# Geaux Code!!!

Welcome to the new home of the _Geax Code_ blog... my channel for sharing musings & ideas on code, business, technology, photography, the list goes on and on.... but mostly about Code!

Based on the **Beautiful Jekyll** theme, running on Github Pages, using CloudFlare DNS... it's amazing what we can accomplish these days with the combined power of open-source projects (thanks to all), and great services by great companies like CloudFlare & Microsoft (Github)!

//TODO:  Update with something helpful about how I set this up with GitPages & Cloudflare!
