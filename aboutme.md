# Who Dat? (e.g. Who am I?)
My name is Brandon and I am a [Cajun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cajuns), husband, geek, software developer, photographer, traveler, consultant, [LSU alumnus](https://www.lsu.edu/) & [Tiger fan](https://lsusports.net/)!

As a Cajun, my personality is very upbeat and outspoken -- occasionally exhibiting the loud-and-proud element that's oh-so prevalent in [South Louisina](http://www.louisianafolklife.org/LT/Articles_Essays/la_3_folk_reg.html#tab3). But I also believe heavily in teamwork! I’m passionate about software technology, and what I love about consulting is the opportunity it provides to help so many different people, in virtually any industry, use technology to improve their experiences.

I also fancy myself as a [psuedo-renaissance-man of tech things](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/renaissance-man), dabbling in a wide variety of technology from software design/architecture, to home-auotmation and a dash of electronics here and there. And strive to become provificient in the things that most benefit my role as a consultant and make my life or, at least more fun! 

Outside of code, one of my favorite passions, is to express my artistic side with [landscape photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/77885066@N06/)...always striving to improve and live in the moment of each shutter.

If you made it here then I truly hope that you have found something that I've shared to be useful, even if it's to learn _what not to do_.

## What I do
The bit above is a little about who I am, and an integral part of what I do...technology consulting!

I am the Director of Technology Consulting at [EXLRT](http://www.exlrt.com) for the US operations. 

My personal philosophy is to strive to provide a "consultant first..." approach to solving problems, which often yields a very different solution than a "technology first..." mindset. And, I also firmlly believe that creating the best solutions is far more art than it is science! 

So by striving for a client-centric & quality based focus, I hope to ensure that solutions add real value by empowering my clients — not constraining them — with technology.

## My experience
I have 17+ years of experience in technology, consulting, and software development. My development experience is full stack & cross platform, using Microsoft and Java technologies, for enterprise solutions. 

I've been fortunate enough to work for some amazing enterprises & Fortune 100 companies (see below).  



## Brands that I feel _blessed_ to have worked with (in no particular order):
- Starbucks
- Hewlett Packard
- ExxonMobil
- Wells Fargo
- American Express
- Universal Studios
- Acer (Tawain)
- AEG Live


## A little more about my background
Before graduating from LSU in 2002, I had already started my career in technology building my first computer around age 13'ish.  By building, I mean that I took it apart and put it back together with what I might estimate as a 10% more efficient design! This claim is substantiated by the fact that I had ~10% of the screws still in my hands while the computer started back up!

Some years later I was building computers on the side to help pay for necessities during college, and worked for the the [LSU Agricultural Center Computing Services](https://www.lsuagcenter.com/portals/our_offices/departments/information-technology) doing PC repair (_it always-was a mouthful to say every time we answered the tech-support phone line_).  

Eventually my desire to learn software development increased commensurately with my financial needs as a student. So, I moved off campus to work as an Automated Test Developer for Lewis Computing Services (a medical software provider at the time). They gave me a raise, provided free food, worked around my class schedule, and basically paid me to learn Visual Basic 5, and 6. At the time I thought it was amazing to get so much... later in life I learned how much of a win-win it was since I was also pretty cheap labor for them and they got tremendous value out of the work we (several other incredibly smart & talented students that worked for them) provided!  But, I wouldn't trade it for the world, as I learned soo much from my colleagues there.

After graudation, I started my professional career in the _Oil & Gas_ field where I began my journey of working with true enterprise technologies. Initially starting with Document Managmeent systems (e.g. FileNet, Documentum) and eventually developing strategic custom applications (for competitive advantage). At one point I also took an ~2 year stint in full-time project management... which provided me with many lessons that I use every day; though, perhaps the most important being that _I'll never be a great project manager!_

Eventually my frustrations & passion pushed me out of that one industry and into technology consulting where I could learn about many industries, companies, brands, etc.

It's was then ( _circa November 2007_ ) that I re-tooled my technololgy skills, and really embraced my love for software architecture, business soultion design, and client consulting.
