# Who Dat? (e.g. Who am I?)
My name is Brandon and I am a (Cajun)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cajuns], husband, geek, software developer, photographer, traveler, consultant, [LSU alumnus](https://www.lsu.edu/) & [Tiger fan](https://lsusports.net/)!

As a Cajun, my personality is very upbeat and outspoken -- occasionally exhibiting the loud-and-proud element that's oh-so prevalent in [South Louisina](http://www.louisianafolklife.org/LT/Articles_Essays/la_3_folk_reg.html#tab3). But I also believe heavily in teamwork! I’m passionate about software technology, and what I love about consulting is the opportunity it provides to help so many different people, in virtually any industry, use technology to improve their experiences.

I also fancy myself as a [psuedo-renaissance-man of tech things](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/renaissance-man), dabbling in a wide variety of technology from software design/architecture, to home-auotmation and a dash of electronics here and there. And strive to become provificient in the things that most benefit my role as a consultant and make my life or, at least more fun! 

#What I do
The bit above is a little about who I am, but it's an integral part of what I do...technology consulting!

I am the Director of Technology Consulting at [EXLRT](http://www.exlrt.com) for the US operations. 

My personal philosophy is to strive to provide a "consultant first..." approach to solving problems, which often yields a very different solution than a "technology first..." mindset. And, I also firmlly believe that creating the best solutions is far more art than it is science! 

So by striving for a client-centric & quality based focus, I hope to ensure that solutions add real value by empowering my clients — not constraining them — with technology.

#A little more about my background

Before graduating from LSU in 2002, I had already started my career in technology building my first computer around age 13'ish.  By building, I mean that I took it apart and put it back together with what I might estimate as a 10% more efficient design! This claim is substantiated by the fact that I had ~10% of the screws still in my hands while the computer started back up!

Some years later I was building computers on the side to help pay for necessities during college, and worked for the the [LSU Agricultural Center Computing Services](https://www.lsuagcenter.com/portals/our_offices/departments/information-technology) doing PC repair (_it always-was a mouthful to say every time we answered the tech-support phone line_).  

As my desire to learn software development increased commensurately with my financial needs, I moved off campus to work as an Automated Test Developer for Lewis Computing Services (a medical software provider)

If you made it here then I truly hope that you have found something that I've shared to be useful, even if it's to learn _what not to do_.


- I rock a great mustache
- I'm extremely loyal to my family

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
