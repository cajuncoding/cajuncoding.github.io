## Developers should learn how things work under the hood...
Develpers need to really learn how their language, and environment, actually work under the hood. I think they get by because some awesome people keep providing details on an as-needed basis in StackOverflow and Github Issue threads, etc... but if you are reading this, then I highly recommend you spend time really learning how your language of choice works under the hood. It will make you a far better developer!
